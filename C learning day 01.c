//C
/* C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, 
imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 
by Dennis M. Ritchie 
at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. 
C is the most widely used computer language. 
It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, 
which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.


C is a middle-level language that combines the features of high-level languages with the functionalism of assembly language.
It is a structured programming language that allows for low-level memory manipulation,
and it is a compiled language that translates the code into machine language for execution.
C is a powerful language that provides a wide range of features,
including data types, control structures, functions, and pointers.
It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development.
C is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications,
including operating systems, compilers, and game development.
C is a language that has stood the test of time and continues to be relevant in modern software development.

// This code prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// It is a simple program that demonstrates the basic structure of a C program.
// The program includes the standard input-output header file <stdio.h>,
// defines the main function, and uses the printf function to output text to the console.
// The return 0; statement indicates that the program has executed successfully.
